# TASK 1 - Iris Flower Classification
During my internship, I worked on some projects. One of the projects involved training a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers based on their measurements. The dataset used in this project was the Iris flower dataset, which is commonly used for classification tasks and consists of three species of flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The goal of this project was to develop a model that could accurately classify Iris flowers based on their measurements.

The Iris flower dataset contains measurements of sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width for 150 Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each species. The dataset used for this project is available in the repository as iris.csv.

To complete the project, I used several Python libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib. In the iris_classification.ipynb Jupyter Notebook, I trained three different models: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier. Each model was trained using the Iris flower dataset and evaluated for its accuracy.

Once the models were trained, I used a new test dataset to assess their performance. This dataset contained measurements of Iris flowers with unknown species. The trained models predicted the species of these flowers, and their accuracy was evaluated.


# TASK 2 - UNEMPLOYMENT ANALYSIS WITH PYTHON
Contained in this repository is a data science project with the aim of analyzing the unemployment rate, specifically during the Covid-19 pandemic. The percentage of unemployed individuals in relation to the total labor force is a crucial economic indicator. By studying and comprehending the trends and factors that influence unemployment, we can obtain valuable insights into the job market and the overall economy.

The primary goal of this project is to examine the unemployment rate during the Covid-19 pandemic. The project will entail gathering relevant data, refining and preprocessing the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

To execute the notebooks and replicate the analysis, make sure to have the following dependencies installed: Python (version 3.6 or higher), Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab, Required Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.).
# TASK 4 -EMAIL SPAM DETECTION WITH MACHINE LEARNING
Introduction
Receiving spam emails is a common experience that can be bothersome, take up time, and pose potential danger. This particular project seeks to address this issue by developing an email spam detector with the use of Python. By utilizing machine learning techniques, we can accurately teach the spam detector to classify emails as either spam or non-spam.

Key Features
The email spam detector is built using Python programming language. Machine learning algorithms are applied for training and classification purposes. Categorical data is transformed using label encoding. Logistic Regression is employed for the classification task. Custom prediction inputs are also allowed.

Installation
To operate the email spam detector, it is necessary to have the below dependencies installed:
Python 3.x
numpy
pandas
scikit-learn

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors
such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you
advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.



Typically, a product and service-based business always need their Data Scientist to predict
their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their
product. So letâ€™s start the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
